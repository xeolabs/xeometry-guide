## Features

Things you can do through the xeometry API:

* Create multiple viewers in a page - see *[Creating a Viewer](creatingAViewer.md)*
* Load multiple 3D glTF 2.0 models into a viewer - see *[Loading Models](loadingModels.md)*
* Query what models and objects are loaded - see *[Querying Models and Objects](queryingModelsAndObjects.md)*
* Show and hide objects - see *[Showing and Hiding Objects](visibility.md)*
* Make objects transparent - see *[Transparency](transparency.md)*
* Translate, rotate and scale objects - see *[Transforming](transforming.md)*
* Assign types (eg. IFC) to objects, so that the types can be used instead of IDs when when specifying objects to viewer methods - see *[Assigning types to objects](assigningTypesToObjects.md)*
* Animate the camera - see *[Controlling the camera](controllingTheCamera.md), [Panning the camera](panningTheCamera.md), [Rotating the camera](rotatingTheCamera.md), [Zooming the camera](zoomingTheCamera.md) and [Camera projections](cameraProjections.md)*
* Move camera to fit objects in view - see *[Fitting things in view](fittingThingsInView.md)*
* Create annotations - see *[Annotations](annotations.md)*
* Create custom clipping planes - see *[Clipping](clipping.md)*
* Create light sources - see *[Creating light sources](creatingLightSources.md)*
* Draw outlines around objects to emphasise them - see *[Outlining](outlining.md)*
* Query 3D boundaries of models and objects - see *[Querying boundaries](queryingBoundaries.md)*
* Query 3D geometry of objects - see *[Querying object geometries](queryingObjectGeomatries.md)*
* Pick objects with canvas coordinates or 3D ray - see *[Picking](picking.md)*
* Take canvas snaphots - see *[Canvas snapshots](canvasSnapshots.md)*
* Save and load JSON bookmarks of viewer state - see *[Bookmarking](bookmarking.md)*

There are bound to be some things the API doesn't do for your app. If your requirements are within the scope of viewing and manipulating glTF content, then please [log the issue](TODO) for discussion.
