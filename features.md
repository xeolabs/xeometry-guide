## Features

Some things you can do through the xeometry API:

* Create multiple viewers in a page - see: [Creating a viewer](creatingAViewer.md)
* Load multiple 3D glTF 2.0 models into a viewer - see: [Loading models](loadingModels.md)
* Show and hide objects - see: [Showing and hiding objects](showingAndHidingObjects.md)
* Make objects transparent - see: [Making objects transparent](makingObjectsTransparent.md)
* Translate, rotate and scale objects - see: [Transforming models and objects](transformingModelsAndObjects.md)
* Animate the camera - see: [Controlling the camera](controllingTheCamera.md), [Panning the camera](panningTheCamera.md), [Rotating the camera](rotatingTheCamera.md) and [Zooming the camera](zoomingTheCamera.md)
* Move camera to fit objects in view - see: [Fitting things in view](fittingThingsInView.md)
* Create annotations - see: [Creating annotations](creatingAnnotations.md)
* Create custom clip planes - see: [Creating clip planes](creatingClipPlanes.md)
* Create light sources - see: [Creating light sources](creatingLightSources.md)
* Draw outlines around objects to emphasise them - see: [Outlining objects](outliningObjects.md)
* Save and load JSON bookmarks of viewer state - see: [Viewer bookmarks](viewerBookmarks.md)
* Dynamically query boundaries of models and objects - see: [Querying boundaries](queryingBoundaries.md)
* Dynamically query geometry of objects - see: [Querying object geometries](queryingObjectGeomatries.md)
* Pick objects with canvas coordinates or 3D ray - see: [Picking objects](picking.md)
* Take canvas snaphots - see: [Canvas snapshots](canvasSnapshots.md)
* Assign types (eg. IFC element types) to objects, so that the types can be used instead of IDs when when specifying objects to viewer methods - see: [Assigning types to objects](assigningTypesToObjects.md)

There are bound to be some things the API doesn't do for your app. If your requirements are within the scope of viewing and manipulating glTF content, then please [log the issue](TODO) for discussion.
