## Features

Things you can do through the xeometry API:

* Create multiple viewers in a page - see [_Creating a Viewer_](creatingAViewer.md)
* Load multiple 3D glTF 2.0 models into a viewer - see [_Loading Models_](loadingModels.md)
* Query what models and objects are loaded - see [_Querying Models and Objects_](queryingModelsAndObjects.md)
* Show and hide objects - see [_Visibility_](visibility.md)
* Make objects transparent - see [_Transparency_](transparency.md)
* Translate, rotate and scale objects - see [_Transforming_](transforming.md)
* Assign types \(eg. IFC\) to objects, so that the types can be used instead of IDs when when specifying objects to viewer methods - see [_Assigning types to objects_](assigningTypesToObjects.md)
* Animate the camera - see [_Controlling the camera_](controllingTheCamera.md)_, _[_Panning the camera_](panningTheCamera.md)_, _[_Rotating the camera_](rotatingTheCamera.md)_, _[_Zooming the camera_](zoomingTheCamera.md)_ and _[_Camera projections_](cameraProjections.md)
* Move camera to fit objects in view - see [_Fitting things in view_](fittingThingsInView.md)
* Create annotations on objects - see [_Annotations_](annotations.md)
* Create custom clipping planes - see [_Clipping_](clipping.md)
* Create light sources - see [_Creating light sources_](creatingLightSources.md)
* Draw outlines around objects to emphasise them - see [_Outlining_](outlining.md)
* Query 3D boundaries of models and objects - see [_Querying Boundaries_](queryingBoundaries.md)
* Query 3D geometry of objects - see [_Querying Geometry_](queryingGeometry.md)
* Pick objects with canvas coordinates or 3D ray - see [_Picking_](picking.md)
* Take canvas snaphots - see [_Canvas snapshots_](canvasSnapshots.md)
* Save and load JSON bookmarks of viewer state - see [_Bookmarking_](bookmarking.md)

There are bound to be some things the API doesn't do for your app. If your requirements are within the scope of viewing and manipulating glTF content, then please [log the issue](TODO) for discussion.
