# FAQ

### Can I make games with xeometry?

You could, but [xeometry](http://xeolabs.com/xeometry) is geared more for applications in CAD, BIM and model visualization. Engines like [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) and [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) would be a better choice for building games, since more game developers are using those engines, and so there will be more game development resources available around those.
