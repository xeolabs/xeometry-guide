### Can I make games with xeometry?

You could, but [xeometry](http://xeolabs.com/xeometry) is geared more for applications in CAD, BIM and model visualization. As such, the culture around xeometry \(and xeogl, its underlying WebGL engine\) is more about visualization than game development. Other engines like [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) and [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) would be a better choice for building games, since more game devs are using those engines, and so there will be more game development resources available around those.
