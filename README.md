# xeometry

**xeometry** is an open source JavaScript library from [@xeographics](https://twitter.com/xeographics) for viewing and interacting with glTF models on WebGL. It lets you load multiple glTF models and show, hide, move, query, measure, xray, slice and annotate their objects through a set of simple data-driven functions. Since it's totally data-driven, xeometry is also able to save and load your creations as JSON "bookmarks".
