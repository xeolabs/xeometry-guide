# xeometry

**xeometry** is an open source \(MIT\) JavaScript library from [@xeographics](https://twitter.com/xeographics) for viewing and interacting with glTF models on WebGL. It lets you load multiple models and show, hide, move, query, measure, xray, slice and annotate their objects through a set of simple data-driven functions. You can use it to build a viewer app, a custom presentation of a glTF model, or just have fun exploring models by live coding with the API.
