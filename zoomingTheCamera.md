# Zooming the Camera

Zooming the camera changes the distance between its _eye_ and _look_ positions, effectively varying the distance between
your eye and the point that you're looking at.

### Examples

Zoom the _eye_ towards _look_ by 12.3 units:

```javascript
viewer.zoom(12.3);
```

Zoom the _eye_ away from _look_ by 5 units:

```javascript
viewer.zoom(-5);
```
